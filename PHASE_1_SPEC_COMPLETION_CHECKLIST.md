## 💬 FAQ

### Q: Are these specs final?
**A:** They're complete and ready for review, but specs evolve as team provides feedback. Schedule review meeting this week.

### Q: Can we start coding before approval?
**A:** Not recommended. Phase 1 foundation is critical. Wait for architecture approval to ensure alignment.

### Q: What if we need to adjust scope?
**A:** Absolutely. Add alternative approaches to docs/ALTERNATIVE_APPROACHES.md (for Phase 1) and discuss at review.

### Q: How do we track progress?
**A:** Use GitHub Project Board + LEO Kit automation. Issues auto-track to board, PRs close issues.

### Q: What if Phase 1 takes longer than 3 weeks?
**A:** Adjust timeline at end of Week 1 review. Better to over-estimate than rush.
