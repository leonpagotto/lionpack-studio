## üöÄ GETTING STARTED: FIRST STEPS

### Step 1: Team Review (1 hour)

```bash
# Each team member:
1. Read START_HERE.md (5 min)
2. Read PHASE_1_ROADMAP.md (10 min)
3. Review role-specific docs (30 min)
4. Ask questions in Slack
```

### Step 2: Environment Setup (1-2 hours)

```bash
cd /Users/leo.de.souza1/lionpack-studio

# Install dependencies
npm install

# Configure environment
cp .env.example .env.local
# Edit .env.local with your API keys

# Start development
npm run dev:backend  # Terminal 1
npm run dev:frontend # Terminal 2
npm run db:start     # Terminal 3

# Verify
curl http://localhost:3001/health
open http://localhost:3000
```

### Step 3: Create GitHub Issues (2 hours)

```bash
# Use templates in PHASE_1_GITHUB_ISSUES_BREAKDOWN.md
# Create first 10 high-priority issues manually
# Then use gh CLI for remaining issues

# Example:
gh issue create --title "Story 1.1: Setup monorepo structure" \
  --body "$(cat << 'EOF'
[Copy body from PHASE_1_GITHUB_ISSUES_BREAKDOWN.md]
EOF
)" --label "epic-1,phase-1,backend"
```

### Step 4: Setup GitHub Project Board (30 min)

```bash
# Create project board columns:
# - Backlog
# - Ready
# - In Progress
# - Review
# - Done

# Add milestone: "Phase 1 - Week 1"
# Filter issues to project board
# Assign to team members
```

### Step 5: First Standup (30 min)
