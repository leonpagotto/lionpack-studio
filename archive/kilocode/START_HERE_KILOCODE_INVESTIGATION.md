## ✅ THE DECISION

### Three Options

**Option A: Stick with Current Plan**

- OpenCode + Morphic + LEO Kit
- 66 days, shipped in 3 weeks
- Good, but not unique
- ❌ Not recommended

**Option B: Use KiloCode as-is**

- Great agents, but desktop-only
- Breaks collaborative vision
- ❌ Not viable

**Option C: Hybrid Multi-Mode IDE** ⭐

- Web-based, collaborative, intelligent
- 80 days, shipped in 4-5 weeks
- First of its kind, defensible advantage
- ✅ **RECOMMENDED**

---

## 🗣️ NEXT STEPS

### Tomorrow: Team Discussion

1. Read EXECUTIVE_SUMMARY_KILOCODE.md (5 min)
2. Quick team sync (30 min)
3. Vote: Go with Hybrid or Current Plan?
4. If yes: Start spike investigation

### If Approved: Week 1

- Deep-dive KiloCode architecture (spike, 2 days)
- Write detailed spec
- Prototype Coder mode
- Validate approach

### Week 2+: Implementation

- Build multi-mode framework
- Implement each mode
- Ship by end of week 5

## 💡 WHY THIS MATTERS

**The Opportunity:**

- KiloCode has brilliant multi-mode agents (proven, 11.5k stars)
- But it's locked into VS Code (desktop-only)
- LionPack is building web-based collaborative IDE
- **Gap:** No web-based multi-mode agent IDE exists

**Our Advantage:**

- Bring KiloCode's genius to the web
- Make it collaborative (multi-user)
- Integrate with LEO Kit workflows
- **Result:** Unique product no one else has

**Why Now:**

- KiloCode is open source (can study their approach)
- Only +14 days of additional work
- Creates genuine competitive advantage
- First-mover in this category
