## üéØ FINAL WORD

**We have a unique opportunity to build something that doesn't exist yet: the first web-based multi-mode AI agent IDE.**

All the analysis is done. The patterns are proven (KiloCode is open source). The timeline is realistic. The advantage is real.

**We just need a team decision to move forward.**

All supporting documentation is ready for review.
