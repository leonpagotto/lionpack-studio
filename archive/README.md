## Why Archive?

**Before Cleanup:**
- 48 markdown files in root directory
- Difficult to navigate
- Duplication of information
- Poor project organization

**After Cleanup:**
- 3 essential files in root
- Clear, organized structure
- Single sources of truth in `/docs/spike-5/`
- Professional project appearance
- Easier for new developers to understand

---

## Access Pattern

### Find Current Information
```
For current project info:
  INDEX.md → /docs/ subdirectories

For spike #5 results:
  INDEX.md → /docs/spike-5/README.md
  
For architecture:
  INDEX.md → /docs/ARCHITECTURE.md
```

### Find Historical Information
```
For Phase 1 history:
  /archive/phase-1/

For Spike 5 investigation process:
  /archive/spike-5/

For planning documents:
  /archive/planning/
```

## Standards Applied

**LEO Workflow Kit Standards:**
- ✅ Clean repository (only essential files in root)
- ✅ Organized structure (topic-based folders)
- ✅ Single sources of truth (no duplication)
- ✅ Clear navigation (INDEX.md as hub)
- ✅ Historical preservation (archive maintains history)
- ✅ Professional appearance (clean root directory)

---

## Notes

- **Do not delete archive:** These files preserve project history and may be needed for reference
- **Restore as needed:** Use `cp` commands to restore any file to root for reference
- **Keep root clean:** Don't add new files to root; organize them in appropriate `/docs/` subdirectories
- **Update INDEX.md:** When adding new documentation, update INDEX.md with navigation links
