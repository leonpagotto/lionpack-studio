## 🏗️ What Gets Built

### The Backend Stack

```
User Request
    ↓
Next.js API Route (/api/workflows/create)
    ↓
leo-client.Orchestrator (analyzeRequest → createWorkflow)
    ↓
LEO Workflow Kit (multi-agent orchestration)
    ↓
Database (PostgreSQL via Supabase)
    ↓
GitHub API (auto-create issues)
```

### 4 Core Modules You'll Implement

1. **Orchestrator** (250+ lines)
   - `analyzeRequest()` — Understand what user wants
   - `createWorkflow()` — Create workflow + GitHub issue
   - `generateSpec()` — Multi-model specification generation
   - `getWorkflowStatus()` — Track workflow progress

2. **WorkflowManager** (70+ lines interface, 300+ lines implementation)
   - CRUD operations on workflows table
   - Status tracking
   - User assignment
   - Database persistence

3. **SpecGenerator** (80+ lines interface, 200+ lines implementation)
   - Call LEO Kit with different models
   - Parse specifications
   - Store in database
   - Return to client

4. **GitHubClient** (100+ lines interface, 300+ lines implementation)
   - Create issues
   - Update issues
   - Add comments
   - Manage projects

### 7+ API Endpoints You'll Create

```
POST   /api/workflows/create       — Create new workflow
GET    /api/workflows/[id]         — Get workflow details
GET    /api/workflows              — List workflows (filterable)
POST   /api/specs/generate         — Generate specification
GET    /api/github/issues          — List GitHub issues
GET    /api/health                 — Health check (done)
```

### Database Schema You'll Create

```
profiles            — User accounts (from Supabase auth)
packs               — Teams
pack_members        — Team membership
projects            — GitHub projects linked to packs
workflows           — Workflow instances
specifications      — Generated specifications
```

## 💡 Key Success Factors

### 1. **Start Strong** ⚡

**Day 1 Critical**:
- ✅ Environment set up (1 hour)
- ✅ Dev server running
- ✅ Tests passing
- ✅ Can hit API endpoint

**Day 1-2**:
- ✅ First method implemented (Orchestrator.analyzeRequest)
- ✅ Tests written
- ✅ First commit pushed

If Day 1-2 go well, momentum builds and Phase 1 will be smooth.

### 2. **Test-First Mindset** 🧪

**For Each Implementation**:
1. Write the interface (already done ✅)
2. Write test cases (specify behavior)
3. Implement the method (make tests pass)
4. Refactor if needed
5. Commit

This guarantees:
- ✅ Code works
- ✅ Edge cases handled
- ✅ 80%+ coverage naturally
- ✅ No surprises later

### 3. **Commit Frequently** 📝

**Minimum daily**:
- 1 commit per feature
- Clear message
- Reference issue #61

**Benefits**:
- ✅ Track progress
- ✅ Easy rollback if needed
- ✅ Show work to team

### 4. **Database Early** 🗄️

**By Nov 1**:
- ✅ Supabase project created
- ✅ Schema created
- ✅ Can query from Node.js
- ✅ GitHub OAuth configured

Don't delay this! It unblocks everything.

### 5. **Regular Standups** 📢

**Daily at same time**:
- What got done?
- What's next?
- Any blockers?
- Time on track?

Use: PHASE_1_PROGRESS_TRACKER.md

## 🚨 Common Pitfalls to Avoid

### ❌ Pitfall 1: Perfectionism
**Problem**: Spending too long on first task  
**Solution**: MVP first, polish later. 80% in 20% of time.

### ❌ Pitfall 2: Skipping Tests
**Problem**: Write code, forget tests, then time crunch  
**Solution**: Tests first. They take same time total but prevent issues.

### ❌ Pitfall 3: Delaying Database
**Problem**: Wait until everything else done to set up DB  
**Solution**: Do database Day 1. It unblocks everything.

### ❌ Pitfall 4: Ignoring Dependencies
**Problem**: Implementing Task 1.5 before Task 1.2 done  
**Solution**: Follow task order. Parallelize only independent tasks.

### ❌ Pitfall 5: No Breaks
**Problem**: Burnout from 10+ hours of coding daily  
**Solution**: Take breaks. Walk. Sleep 8 hours. Sustainable pace wins.
