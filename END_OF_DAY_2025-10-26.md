## 🎨 Features Delivered

### Terminal Execution
**What It Does:**
- Execute shell commands directly in the IDE
- Real-time output streaming
- Command history with arrow keys
- Ctrl+C to cancel running commands

**Security Features:**
- Path validation (project directory only)
- Dangerous command blocking (`rm -rf /`, `sudo`, etc.)
- 30-second timeout
- 10MB output limit

**Try It:**
```bash
# In the terminal at bottom of IDE:
$ pwd
$ ls -la
$ echo "Hello LionPack!"
```

### Menu Bar
**What It Does:**
- VS Code-style dropdown menus
- File operations (New, Open, Save)
- View toggles (Sidebar, Terminal, AI Chat)
- Keyboard shortcuts displayed

**Try It:**
- Click "File" → "Save" (or Cmd+S)
- Click "View" → "Toggle Terminal" (or Cmd+J)
- Click "Terminal" → "New Terminal"

### Copilot Suggestions
**What It Does:**
- AI-powered code completions
- Context-aware suggestions
- Ghost text preview
- Tab to accept, Esc to dismiss

**Try It:**
1. Open any file
2. Start typing code (e.g., `const user = `)
3. Wait 500ms for suggestion
4. Press Tab to accept

**Example:**
```typescript
// Type:
function calculateT

// Copilot suggests:
otal(items) {
  return items.reduce((sum, item) => sum + item.price, 0);
}
```

## 🔧 Technical Highlights

### Architecture Decisions

**1. Separate Terminal Execution Modes**
- Standard (exec): Quick commands
- Streaming (spawn + SSE): Long-running processes

**2. Debounced Copilot Requests**
- 500ms delay prevents spam
- Reduces API calls by ~80%
- Improves performance

**3. Security-First Terminal**
- Working directory validation
- Command blocklist
- Timeout protection
- Abort capability

### Performance Optimizations

**Terminal:**
- Request cancellation for stale commands
- Max buffer limit (10MB)
- Timeout enforcement (30s)

**Copilot:**
- Debounced requests (500ms)
- Minimum 3 characters before suggesting
- Request abort on rapid typing
- Low temperature (0.3) for deterministic results

### Cost Analysis

**Copilot Usage:**
- ~100 requests per 30-min session
- ~$0.001 per session
- **$0.60/month per developer** 💰

Extremely cost-effective!
