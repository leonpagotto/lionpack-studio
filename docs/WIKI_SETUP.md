# Constitution System

> **Development Standards in a Single File**

## What is a Constitution?

A Constitution is a declarative YAML file (`.lionpack/constitution.yml`) that defines your project's:

- **Technical Stack** ‚Äî Languages, frameworks, versions
- **Code Standards** ‚Äî Formatting, linting, naming conventions
- **UX/UI Principles** ‚Äî Design system, accessibility, responsive design
- **AI Agent Alignment** ‚Äî What "good code" means for your project
- **Testing Requirements** ‚Äî Coverage, test types, strategies
- **Performance Budgets** ‚Äî Core Web Vitals, bundle size limits

## Why Use Constitutions?

### For Solo Developers

- ‚úÖ Define your coding style once
- ‚úÖ AI becomes your senior developer pair programmer
- ‚úÖ Consistency across all projects
- ‚úÖ Less decision fatigue

### For Teams

- ‚úÖ Onboard new developers instantly
- ‚úÖ No more style guide debates
- ‚úÖ Automated code review for standards
- ‚úÖ Focus reviews on logic, not formatting

### For AI Agents

- ‚úÖ Clear instructions on what "good" means
- ‚úÖ Context-aware suggestions
- ‚úÖ Aligned with project goals
- ‚úÖ Continuous learning from feedback

# Frequently Asked Questions

## General

### What is LionPack Studio?

LionPack Studio is a collaborative web IDE that combines AI-powered code generation, workflow automation, and real-time collaboration ‚Äî all while enforcing your team's quality standards automatically.

### Is it free?

Yes! LionPack Studio is open-source (MIT License). You can use it for free, forever.

### What makes it different from VS Code / GitHub Copilot?

LionPack Studio is **constitution-aware** ‚Äî AI agents read your project's standards file and enforce them automatically. It's not just code completion, it's culture enforcement.

## Constitution System

### What is a Constitution file?

A YAML file that defines your project's technical standards, design principles, and AI alignment rules. Think of it as a "DNA file" for your project.

### Do I need to create one?

No, but it's highly recommended. Without a constitution, AI agents use sensible defaults. With one, they follow YOUR standards.

### Can I share constitutions between projects?

Yes! Constitutions are portable. You can fork community templates or share your own.

## AI & Code Generation

### Which AI models are supported?

Currently:

- Anthropic Claude (3.5 Sonnet, Opus, Haiku)
- Google Gemini (coming in Story 3.10)
- OpenAI GPT-4 (planned)

### Does AI replace developers?

No. AI handles boilerplate and enforces standards. You handle creative logic and architecture.

### How does AI know my coding style?

It reads your `.lionpack/constitution.yml` file and learns from your feedback.

## Collaboration

### How many users can collaborate?

We recommend 1-4 users per "pack" (project team) for optimal flow.

### Does it work for solo developers?

Absolutely! Solo developers get an AI pair programmer that knows their standards.

## Technical

### What stack is it built on?

- Next.js 14 + React 18 + TypeScript
- Tailwind CSS for styling
- LEO Kit for workflow automation
- Supabase for database and auth
- OpenCode for editor foundation

### Can I self-host it?

Yes! Full self-hosting instructions coming soon.

### Is my code stored on your servers?

No. Your code stays in your GitHub repositories. We don't store code.

## Pricing

### Is there a paid tier?

Not yet. LionPack Studio is currently free and open-source. Future plans may include:

- Pro features for teams
- Enterprise on-premises hosting
- Priority support

All core features will remain free forever.
