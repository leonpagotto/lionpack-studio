# UI Testing Feedback & Fixes - October 27, 2025

**Session:** Testing local development server at http://localhost:3001
**Branch:** feature/story-3.10-multi-ai-provider
**Tested By:** Leo

---

## ‚úÖ FIXED Issues

### 1. **CodeEditor Scrolling & Line Number Overlap** ‚úÖ FIXED

**Problem:**

- Double scrollbars appearing
- Line numbers overlapping with code
- UI completely messed up when opening files
- Absolute positioned layers conflicting

**Root Cause:**

- Both textarea (editable) and syntax-highlighted overlay were `absolute inset-0`
- Both trying to render in same space causing visual conflicts
- Parent div had `overflow-hidden` preventing proper scrolling

**Solution Applied:**

- Removed dual-layer absolute positioning approach
- Changed to single-layer read-only display with proper scrolling
- Line numbers now integrated into syntax highlighting display
- Removed conflicting textarea overlay (for now - will restore editing later)
- Copilot suggestions moved to fixed positioning overlay

**Files Changed:**

- `apps/web/components/KiloEditor/CodeEditor.tsx`

**Commit:**

```bash
git commit -m "fix: resolve CodeEditor double-scrollbar and overlapping line numbers issue"
```

**Status:** ‚úÖ PUSHED to remote

## üîç TESTED & WORKING

### 1. **Development Server** ‚úÖ WORKING

- Server starts successfully on port 3001 (port 3000 was in use)
- Next.js 14.2.33 running
- Hot reload working
- Environment variables loaded from `.env.local`

### 2. **File System API** ‚úÖ WORKING

- `/api/files` endpoint responding
- Can list directory contents (`GET /api/files?path=.`)
- Can read files (`GET /api/files/read?path=<file>`)
- Returns proper 400 for directories (expected behavior)
- Returns proper 304 for cached files

### 3. **AI Chat API** ‚úÖ WORKING

- `/api/chat` endpoint responding
- Accepts POST requests
- Returns 200 status
- Gemini provider integrated
- Stream mode supported

### 4. **Copilot Status API** ‚úÖ WORKING

- `/api/copilot/status` endpoint responding
- Returns 304 (not modified) when cached
- Shows GitHub OAuth warning (expected - not configured yet)

---

## ‚ùå STILL BROKEN (Needs Fixing)

### 1. **Folder Opening Not Working** ‚ùå BROKEN

**Problem:**

- "Open Folder" button doesn't open native folder picker
- Cannot browse local filesystem outside project
- FileTree only shows project files, not arbitrary folders

**Likely Cause:**

- Browser File System Access API not implemented
- Need to use `window.showDirectoryPicker()` API
- Requires user permission and secure context (HTTPS or localhost)

**What Needs to Be Done:**

1. Add File System Access API polyfill/wrapper
2. Implement folder picker in `useFileSystem` hook
3. Handle permission requests
4. Store folder handles in IndexedDB for persistence

**Priority:** HIGH (Core UX feature)

---

### 2. **GitHub Integration Missing from UI** ‚ùå MISSING

**Problem:**

- No GitHub panel visible in UI
- GitVisualization components exist but not rendered
- No way to see commits, branches, or PR status

**What Exists:**

- Components in `apps/web/components/GitVisualization/`:
  - CommitGroupPreview.tsx
  - DiffViewer.tsx
  - ConflictResolutionPanel.tsx

**What's Missing:**

- GitHub panel not added to main page layout
- No GitHub sidebar or bottom panel
- OAuth configuration incomplete (`GITHUB_CLIENT_ID` and `GITHUB_CLIENT_SECRET` not set)

**What Needs to Be Done:**

1. Add GitHub OAuth credentials to `.env.local`
2. Create GitHubPanel component or sidebar
3. Add to main page layout (pages/index.tsx)
4. Wire up commit/branch/PR visualization
5. Add GitHub status to status bar

**Priority:** MEDIUM (Nice to have, not blocking core development)

---

### 3. **AI Assistant Partially Working** ‚ö†Ô∏è PARTIALLY WORKING

**What Works:**

- ChatContainer component renders
- API endpoint `/api/chat` responds
- Streaming works
- Gemini provider integrated

**What Doesn't Work:**

- Code editing from AI chat not integrated
- AI-generated code not applied to CodeEditor
- No visual feedback when AI is thinking
- No error handling UI for failed API calls

**What Needs to Be Done:**

1. Restore editable textarea in CodeEditor (removed in fix)
2. Wire up AI-generated code to CodeEditor onChange
3. Add loading states to ChatContainer
4. Add error toast/notification system
5. Test multi-turn conversations

**Priority:** HIGH (Core feature - AI is the main value prop)

---

### 4. **Code Editing Disabled** ‚ö†Ô∏è REGRESSION FROM FIX

**Problem:**

- Fixed scrolling issue but removed editing capability
- CodeEditor is now read-only
- Cannot modify files directly

**Root Cause:**

- Quick fix removed textarea to eliminate scrolling conflict
- Need better solution that preserves both display and editing

**What Needs to Be Done:**

1. Implement proper editable code editor
2. Options:
   - **Option A:** Use CodeMirror or Monaco Editor (heavy but full-featured)
   - **Option B:** Re-implement dual-layer with proper synchronization
   - **Option C:** Use contentEditable div with careful cursor management

**Recommended:** Option A (Monaco Editor - same as VS Code)

**Priority:** CRITICAL (Cannot edit code = not useful as IDE)

---

## üéØ Immediate Next Steps (Prioritized)

### Critical (Must Fix Now)

1. **Restore Code Editing** - Implement proper editable code component
   - Use Monaco Editor or CodeMirror
   - Preserve syntax highlighting
   - Keep Copilot suggestions working

### High Priority (Fix This Week)

2. **Folder Opening** - Implement native folder picker
   - File System Access API
   - Permission handling
   - Folder persistence

3. **AI Code Integration** - Wire up AI-generated code to editor
   - Apply code suggestions
   - Multi-file generation
   - Error handling

### Medium Priority (Fix Next Week)

4. **GitHub Integration** - Add GitHub panel to UI
   - OAuth configuration
   - Commit visualization
   - Branch/PR status

5. **Error Handling & UX** - Add proper error states
   - Toast notifications
   - Loading spinners
   - Error recovery

## üìä Overall Assessment

**What's Working Well:**

- ‚úÖ Infrastructure is solid (APIs working)
- ‚úÖ File system backend functional
- ‚úÖ AI chat backend functional
- ‚úÖ Component architecture is good

**What Needs Work:**

- ‚ùå Code editing (critical regression from fix)
- ‚ùå Folder browsing (core feature missing)
- ‚ùå GitHub UI (planned feature not implemented)
- ‚ö†Ô∏è AI integration (backend works, frontend incomplete)

**Estimated Effort to Production-Ready:**

- **Code Editing:** 1-2 days (integrate Monaco)
- **Folder Opening:** 1 day (File System API)
- **AI Integration:** 0.5 day (wire up existing APIs)
- **GitHub UI:** 1-2 days (OAuth + UI components)
- **Polish & Testing:** 1 day

**Total:** ~5-7 days of focused development
