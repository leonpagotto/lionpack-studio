## üêõ Common Issues & Solutions

### Issue: "Port 3000 is in use"

**Solution:** Server automatically tries port 3001. Use that URL instead.

### Issue: "GitHub token invalid"

**Solution:** 
1. Verify token in `.env.local` starts with `ghp_`
2. Check token hasn't expired
3. Verify token has `repo` and `workflow` scopes
4. Restart dev server after changing `.env.local`

### Issue: "Approval UI doesn't appear"

**Solution:**
1. Check browser console for errors
2. Verify AI response includes GitHub operation tags (`<github_pr>`, etc.)
3. Check Network tab for API call failures
4. Ensure server is running and accessible

### Issue: "Operation executes but nothing happens on GitHub"

**Solution:**
1. Verify `NEXT_PUBLIC_GITHUB_OWNER` and `NEXT_PUBLIC_GITHUB_REPO` are correct
2. Check GitHub token permissions
3. Verify repository exists and you have write access
4. Check server logs for API errors

---

## üìù Notes

- **Token Security:** Never commit real GitHub tokens to git
- **Clean Up:** Delete test PRs, issues, and branches after testing
- **Rate Limits:** GitHub API has rate limits (5,000 requests/hour with token)
- **Repository:** Tests should be run on a test repository, not production

---
