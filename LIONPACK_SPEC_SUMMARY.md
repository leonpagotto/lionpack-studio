## 🎯 Key Highlights

### Problem & Solution Clearly Defined

**Problem:**

- Developers juggle fragmented tools (IDE, terminal, GitHub, AI chat)
- Slow feedback loops kill momentum
- No unified view of who's doing what
- Small teams lack clear collaboration patterns

**Solution:**

- Single integrated web IDE combining:
  - Monaco editor (OpenCode foundation)
  - LEO Kit workflow automation
  - Real-time collaboration (Phases 2+)
  - GitHub as source of truth
  - AI assistant with project context

### User-Centric Approach

Three personas well-defined:

1. **Solo Developer** – From idea to prototype in IDE
2. **Small Pack (2-4)** – Real-time collab with clear roles
3. **Open Source Maintainer** – AI-assisted triage & automation

### Realistic 3-Week Phase 1 Plan

**Week 1:** Infrastructure + GitHub OAuth
**Week 2:** File operations + UI layout
**Week 3:** Terminal + Error handling + QA

Breaking down into 8 manageable epics with concrete deliverables.

### Complete API Contract

All 20+ endpoints documented with:

- Request/response examples
- Error handling
- Rate limiting
- Authentication
- Ready for frontend/backend teams to implement in parallel

## 🏗️ Architecture Highlights

### Tech Stack (Smart Choices)

| Layer                | Tools                   | Why                                       |
| -------------------- | ----------------------- | ----------------------------------------- |
| **Frontend**         | React + Next.js         | Modern, fast, SEO-friendly                |
| **Editor**           | Monaco (OpenCode)       | Industry standard, rich plugins           |
| **Real-time**        | Yjs + Supabase          | Proven collab, PostgreSQL CRDT            |
| **Auth**             | Supabase + GitHub OAuth | Zero friction for devs, industry standard |
| **Backend API**      | Node.js + Express       | JavaScript full-stack                     |
| **Workflow**         | LEO Kit (existing)      | Already built, battle-tested              |
| **Containerization** | Docker                  | Consistent environments                   |

### No Custom Task Manager

**Key Decision:** GitHub issues are the source of truth

- No custom database for tasks
- Synced to UI in real-time
- Maintains transparency & version control
- Leverages existing LEO Kit integrations

### Phased Approach (Smart Scope)

**Phase 1 (3 weeks):** Single-user IDE foundation
**Phase 2 (3 weeks):** Real-time collaboration
**Phase 3 (3 weeks):** AI orchestration
**Phase 4 (3 weeks):** Polish & brand

Each phase builds on previous; can pause & iterate.

## 📊 Implementation Readiness

### ✅ Ready to Code

The specifications are detailed enough to start coding immediately:

- Monorepo structure defined
- All API endpoints documented
- Authentication flow diagrammed
- Component tree outlined
- Docker setup provided
- Acceptance criteria clear

### 🧠 Team Alignment

The documents enable:

- **Backend team** → Can start auth service + file API
- **Frontend team** → Can start layout + editor component
- **DevOps** → Can setup Supabase + Docker
- **QA** → Can start test planning

### 📋 Tracking & Review

With LEO Kit:

## 🚀 Next Steps

### Immediate (This Week)

1. **Team Review** – Share specs with dev team
   - Slack discussion channel
   - Schedule 1-hour walkthrough
   - Collect feedback & concerns

2. **Approval Gate** – Get sign-off on:
   - Technical approach
   - Timeline (realistic?)
   - Team capacity
   - Architecture decisions

3. **Refine** – Update specs based on feedback
   - Adjust timeline if needed
   - Add missing context
   - Address concerns

### Short-term (Next Week)

1. **Create GitHub Issues** – Break specs into actionable tasks

   ```bash
   leo issue              # Interactive mode, or
   gh issue create --title "..." --body "..." --label "phase-1,backend,auth"
   ```

2. **Setup Environment** – Parallel work:
   - Supabase project creation
   - GitHub repo configuration
   - Docker environment setup
   - Monorepo scaffolding

3. **Kickoff Sprint** – Week 1 goals:
   - [ ] Infrastructure setup complete
   - [ ] CI/CD pipeline working
   - [ ] OAuth flow foundation in place
   - [ ] Team pair-programming on first tasks
