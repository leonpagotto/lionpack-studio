## 📞 Communication Channels

**Daily Standup:** 9:30 AM  
**Weekly Planning:** Monday 10:00 AM  
**Demo Day:** Every 2 weeks, Friday 10:00 AM  

**Issues & Questions:**
- GitHub Issues for technical tasks
- Discord/Slack for quick questions
- Weekly sync for blockers

---

## ⚠️ Risk Mitigation

### Risk 1: Claude API Integration Delays
**Mitigation:**
- Have demo API responses pre-saved
- Mock Claude API responses for demo
- Test Claude connection early (Week 1)

### Risk 2: Component Performance Issues
**Mitigation:**
- Profile performance early
- Setup monitoring dashboard
- Have performance targets in place

### Risk 3: Demo Failure
**Mitigation:**
- Test demo 3x before presentation
- Have recorded demo backup
- Have static screenshots backup
- Honest communication with stakeholders

### Risk 4: Scope Creep
**Mitigation:**
- Strict story acceptance criteria
- Only bugs allowed mid-sprint
- New features for future sprints

---

## 📊 Metrics to Track

**Daily:**
- Lines of code written
- Tests passing/failing
- Bugs found and fixed

**Weekly:**
- Velocity (story points completed)
- Code coverage
- Performance benchmarks

**Per Demo:**
- Feature completion %
