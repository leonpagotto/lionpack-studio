# 🎬 Phase 2: Demo-Driven Development Strategy

**Date:** October 25, 2025  
**Focus:** Build features → Show stakeholders every 2 weeks  
**Goal:** Regular visible progress with biweekly demos  

---

## Executive Summary

Instead of building for 14 weeks then showing results, we show working demos **every 2 weeks**:

- **Week 2:** Mode Router demo (intent detection working)
- **Week 4:** Coder Mode demo (AI generating code)
- **Week 6:** Verifier demo (code validation working)
- **Week 8:** Full integration demo (all 3 working together)
- **Week 12:** Beta results demo (user feedback + improvements)
- **Week 14:** Production launch demo (going live!)

This keeps stakeholders engaged and enables course corrections early.

   - Show static screenshots
   - Explain technical issue
   - Demonstrate with alternative method

2. **Scope creep protection:**
   - Strict acceptance criteria per demo
   - Only critical bugs allowed mid-sprint
   - New features for next sprint

3. **Performance issue backup:**
   - Have pre-generated results cached
   - Show performance optimization plan
   - Demonstrate on smaller dataset

---

## Post-Demo Actions

### Immediate (Same Day)
- Document demo feedback
- Take notes on stakeholder reactions
- Note any technical issues
