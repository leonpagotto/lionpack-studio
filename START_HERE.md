## 🎨 PROJECT OVERVIEW

### The Vision

**LionPack Studio:** An AI-powered collaborative development environment for solo developers and small teams (1–4 people) to go from idea to working prototype fast, while maintaining clarity, collaboration, and version control.

### The Stack

```
Frontend:      React + Monaco Editor + Tailwind CSS
Backend:       Node.js / Express
Realtime:      Supabase (authentication, presence, sync)
AI:            OpenAI / Claude (via LEO orchestrator)
Workflow:      LEO Kit (GitHub integration, issue automation)
Integration:   GitHub API (issues, projects, PRs)
Containerization: Docker
```

### The Epics (Phase 1)

1. **OpenCode Integration** – Integrate OpenCode IDE into LionPack
2. **LEO Backend Integration** – Connect LEO Kit API layer
3. **AI Orchestrator** – Setup multi-model LLM routing
4. **Authentication** – GitHub OAuth 2.0 implementation
5. **File Operations** – Read/write/delete with git backing
6. **Terminal Integration** – Execute commands in containerized runtimes
7. **Chat Sidebar** – LEO Assistant with context awareness
8. **Pack Collaboration** – Realtime editing & presence

### The Timeline

```
Week 1:
  Mon–Tue: Foundation (auth, file ops, terminal)
  Wed–Fri: Backend services (LEO integration, orchestrator)

Week 2:
  Mon–Tue: Frontend setup (editor, chat UI)
  Wed–Fri: Integration (API calls, realtime sync)

Week 3:
  Mon–Tue: Polish & optimization
  Wed–Fri: Testing & deployment prep
```
